# Invisibility Cloak with Python + OpenCV ðŸ§´

Bring some magic to your webcam! This project creates a real-time **invisibility effect** using a colored cloth. Wherever the cloak appears, it is replaced by the background, making it look like the person is invisible â€” just like Harry Potter!

* **Color detection** in HSV color space
* **Masking and background replacement** for invisibility effect
* Works with any **bright-colored cloak** (red, green, blue)
* Optional improvements: glowing outlines, floating hand effect (like Wednesdayâ€™s Thing), AR filters

## Tech Stack

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV
* NumPy
